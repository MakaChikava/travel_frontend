A collaborative project created by: Maka, McKee, and Romina.

This web app is a tool for travelers designed to help with the packing process when planning a trip. This app allows you to select a city, view the current weather there and provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) packing list. When using the search weather feature, the app will provide numerical as well as text information about the weather and will display a suggested packing list based on the temperature.

Technologies Used: MongoDB Atlas, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
